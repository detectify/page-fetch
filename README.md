# page-fetch

page-fetch is a tool for researchers that lets you:

* Fetch web pages using headless Chrome, storing all fetched resources including JavaScript files
* Run arbitrary JavaScript on many web pages and see the returned values


## Installation

page-fetch is written with Go and can be installed with `go get`:

```
▶ go get github.com/detectify/page-fetch
```

Or you can clone the respository and build it manually:

```
▶ git clone https://github.com/detectify/page-fetch.git
▶ cd page-fetch
▶ go install
```

### Dependencies

page-fetch uses [chromedp](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp), which requires
that a Chrome or Chromium browser be installed. It uses the following list of
executable names in attempting to execute a browser:

* `headless_shell`
* `headless-shell`
* `chromium`
* `chromium-browser`
* `google-chrome`
* `google-chrome-stable`
* `google-chrome-beta`
* `google-chrome-unstable`
* `/usr/bin/google-chrome`


## Basic Usage

page-fetch takes a list of URLs as its input on `stdin`. You can provide the input list using IO redirection:

```
▶ page-fetch < urls.txt
```

Or using the output of another command:

```
▶ grep admin urls.txt | page-fetch
```

By default, responses are stored in a directory called 'out', which is created if it does not exist:

```
▶ echo https://detectify.com | page-fetch
GET https://detectify.com/ 200 text/html; charset=utf-8
GET https://detectify.com/site/themes/detectify/css/detectify.css?v=1621498751 200 text/css
GET https://detectify.com/site/themes/detectify/img/detectify_logo_black.svg 200 image/svg+xml
GET https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Merriweather:300i 200 text/css; charset=utf-8
...
▶ tree out
out
├── detectify.com
│   ├── index
│   ├── index.meta
│   └── site
│       └── themes
│           └── detectify
│               ├── css
│               │   ├── detectify.css
│               │   └── detectify.css.meta
...
```

The directory structure used in the output directory mirrors the directory structure used on the target websites.
A ".meta" file is stored for each request that contains the originally requested URL, including the query string),
the request and response headers etc.


## Options

You can get the page-fetch help output by running `page-fetch -h`:

```
▶ page-fetch -h
Request URLs using headless Chrome, storing the results

Usage:
  page-fetch [options] < urls.txt

Options:
  -c, --concurrency <int>   Concurrency Level (default 2)
  -e, --exclude <string>    Do not save responses matching the provided string (can be specified multiple times)
  -i, --include <string>    Only save requests matching the provided string (can be specified multiple times)
  -j, --javascript <string> JavaScript to run on each page
  -o, --output <string>     Output directory name (default 'out')
  -p, --proxy <string>      Use proxy on given URL
  -s, --skip-save-response  Do not save responses in general
  -w, --overwrite           Overwrite output files when they already exist
      --no-third-party      Do not save responses to requests on third-party domains
      --third-party         Only save responses to requests on third-party domains
```

### Concurrency

You can change how many headless Chrome processes are used with the `-c` / `--concurrency` option.
The default value is 2.

### Excluding responses based on content-type

You can choose to not save responses that match particular content types with the `-e` / `--exclude` option.
Any response with a content-type that partially matches the provided value will not be stored; so you can,
for example, avoid storing image files by specifying:

```
▶ page-fetch --exclude image/
```

The option can be specified multiple times to exclude multiple different content-types.

### Including responses based on content-type

Rather than excluding specific content-types, you can opt to only save certain content-types with the
`-i` / `--include` option:

```
▶ page-fetch --include text/html
```

The option can be specified multiple times to include multiple different content-types.

### Running JavaScript on each page

You can run arbitrary JavaScript on each page with the `-j` / `--javascript` option. The return value
of the JavaScript is converted to a string and printed on a line prefixed with "JS":

```
▶ echo https://example.com | page-fetch --javascript document.domain
GET https://example.com/ 200 text/html; charset=utf-8
JS (https://example.com): example.com
```

This option can be used for a very wide variety of purposes. As an example, you could extract the `href`
attribute from all links on a webpage:

```
▶ echo https://example.com | page-fetch --javascript '[...document.querySelectorAll("a")].map(n => n.href)' | grep ^JS
JS (https://example.com): [https://www.iana.org/domains/example]
```

### Setting the output directory name

By default, files are stored in a directory called `out`. This can be changed with the `-o` / `--output` option:

```
▶ echo https://example.com | page-fetch --output example
GET https://example.com/ 200 text/html; charset=utf-8
▶ find example/ -type f
example/example.com/index
example/example.com/index.meta
```

The directory is created if it does not already exist.

### Using a proxy

The `-p` / `--proxy` option can be used to specify a proxy for all requests to use. For example, to use the Burp Suite
proxy with default settings, you could run:

```
▶ echo https://example.com | page-fetch --proxy http://localhost:8080
```

### Overwriting files

By default, when a file already exists, a new file is created with a numeric suffix, e.g. if `index` already exists,
`index.1` will be created. This behaviour can be overridden with the `-w` / `--overwrite` option. When the option is
used matching files will be overwritten instead.

### Excluding third-party responses

You may sometimes wish to exclude responses from third-party domains. This can be done with the `--no-third-party` option.
Any responses to requests for domains that do not match the input URL, or one of its subdomains, will not be saved.

### Including only third-party responses

On rare occasions you may wish to *only* store responses to third party domains. This can be done with the `--third-party` option.
